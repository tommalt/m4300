A blog entry about sudo from linux academy

The sudo command allows a user to run a command with escalated (root)
privileges.

A user can only use the sudo command if they are part of the sudo(ers)
group, as specified in /etc/sudoers

In order to edit /etc/sudoers the visudo(1) command must be used.
Users need to enter their password when running sudo. 

By default, environment variables from the current shell do not get
passed to the root shell when sudo is run. Passing the -E switch
to sudo will make the current environment persist.

Bonus
when running sudo, any processes started vis process substitution
will NOT be run as root:

ex)
$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlp2s0 -c <(wpa_passphrase ESSID PASSWD)

here, wpa_passphrase will not be run by root, but rather the current
user.
