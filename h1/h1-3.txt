A blog entry about sudo from linux academy

The sudo command allows a user to run a command with escalated (root)
privileges. This allows them to do things they normally are not allowed
to do.

A user can only use the sudo command if they are part of the sudo(ers)
group, as specified in /etc/sudoers

In order to edit /etc/sudoers the visudo(1) command must be used and
must be run by the root user or someone with sudo privileges (sudo visudo).

Users need to enter their password when running sudo (although this
can be changed by editing /etc/sudoers). 

By default, environment variables from the current shell do not get
passed to the root shell when sudo is run. Passing the -E switch
to sudo will make the current environment persist.

sudo allows you to run commands as other users besides root
	$ sudo -u apache2 rm /var/www/html/index.php

[Bonus]
The following command will fail:

$ sudo wpa_supplicant -i wlp2s0 -c <(wpa_passphrase ESSID PASSWORDD)

with something like:
Failed to open config file '/dev/fd/63', error: No such file or directory

This is because, by default, sudo closes all open file descriptors
other than stdin, stdout, and stderr (see sudo(8), option -C)

[Bonus++]
write `Defaults insults` in /etc/sudoers for some interesting feedback
upon typing an incorrect password.
