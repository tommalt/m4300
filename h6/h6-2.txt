The output is: "1141136567666"

In the function `void heavyPrinting()`, 2 objects
`object1` `object2` are default constructed.
this prints '11'

in the expression:
  object1 = object2
the copy assignment operator is invoked, printing '4'

`object3` is default constructed, printing '1'

myFunction() is called
`temp` is default constructed, printing '1'

so far we have "11411"

temp is returned from myFunction(). NRVO is
not performed due to -fno-elide-constructors
the expression `return temp` creates an rvalue,
invoking the move constructor
this prints '3'

next, temp is destroyed, printing '6'

we have "1141136"

the rvalue `return temp` is moved into
the result of the function call, invoking the
move assignment operator, this prints '5' `return temp`
is then destroyed, printing '6'

we have "114113656"

std::cout << "7"

we have "1141136567"
object3, 2, and 1 are destructed, printing '666'

we have "1141136567666"
